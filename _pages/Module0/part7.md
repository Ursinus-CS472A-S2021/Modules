<p>
Just one last thing!  We also need to make sure that Python works on your computer.  Luckily, there is a great software bundle called "Anaconda Python" that comes with everything we need in the course.  Please <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com/Teaching/CS371_S2021/Software/index.html">click here</a> to follow the directions to install this software on your computer.  
</p>

<p>
Once you have Python installed, <a href = "../images/Module0/test.py">click here</a> to download some code that we will use to test it, and place it in your <code>CS371</code> folder (or wherever else you plan to store your class projects..but it is recommended that you keep them organized and back them up regularly).  Then, open Spyder, and go to <BR>
<code>File->Open</code><BR>
and open the <code>test.py</code> file that you just downloaded.  Finally, click the run button, which looks like this:<BR><BR>

<img src = "../images/Module0/Run.png">
<BR><BR>
Then, <b>send me a screenshot of the image that pops up in the console to the right of Spyder, using a private message on Microsoft Teams</b>
</p>

<p>
Please be sure also that you are able to launch Jupyter, as we may use this from time to time for quick examples and multimedia data.
