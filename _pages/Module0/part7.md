Just one last thing!  We also need to make sure that Python works on your computer.  Luckily, there is a great software bundle called "Anaconda Python" that comes with everything we need in the course.  Please <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com/Teaching/CS371_S2021/Software/index.html">click here</a> to follow the directions to install this software on your computer.  
</p>

<p>
Once you have Python installed, <a href = "../images/Module0/test.py">click here</a> to download some code that we will use to test it, and place it in your <code>CS371</code> folder (or wherever else you plan to store your class projects..but it is recommended that you keep them organized and back them up regularly).  Then, open Spyder, and go to <BR>
<code>File->Open</code><BR>
and open the <code>test.py</code> file that you just downloaded.  Finally, click the run button, which looks like this:<BR><BR>

This will install a couple of packages that we'll use in the course (<a href = "https://librosa.org/">librosa</a> and <a href = "https://essentia.upf.edu/">essentia</a>), and then it will plot an image, which will show up to the right of Spyder or in the "plots pane" in newer versions.  <b>Send me a screenshot of the image that the code generates as a private message on Microsoft Teams</b>
</p>

<p>
Please be sure also that you are able to launch Jupyter, as we may use this from time to time for organizing collections of audio examples in note form.
