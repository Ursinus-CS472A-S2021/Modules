<p>
Please <a href = "https://doodle.com/poll/sacgq7xtxdc8e5dp">click here</a> fill out a Doodle poll to indicate <b>every block in which you can make at least 30 minutes of office hours in your schedule</b> (you can skip this if you've already done it for CS 371).  I am aiming to have 5 drop-in hours total over Discord, and I want everyone to be able to make at least one of them per week.  Of course, I will also do my best to answer messages over Discord, Teams, and e-mail, but live chats are often quite helpful when working through programmatic and conceptual hurdles.
